# Description

The number 1 player in this game, geopy hit 3000 elo last week. I want to figure out where they train to be the best.

Flag is the address of this player (according to google maps), in the following format all lowercase:

utflag{<street-address>-<city>-<zip-code>}

For example, if the address is 110 Inner Campus Drive, Austin, TX 78705, the flag would be utflag{110-inner-campus-drive-austin-78705}
